## ❓Problem
In today's world, we fail to give time to our grandparents and other senior citizens and as a matter of fact, they get lonely .

## 💡Solution
So, we have come up with a solution. We are building a website named Silent Boomers, which is a platform for the senior citizens ,where they can talk to like-minded people,share their own feelings and thought about their common interests.They can even buy and sell their handmade goods.

## 🙌Overview
Lets talk about this works.

So to begin with,in this website, we are using speech to text converter.
## 🏠Home
First, we have the Home page.
## 🎧Listeners
Second, we have the Listeners section where they can share their worries and thoughts by calling the helpline number.

Next, we have the Community section.There are various communities under this section: 
### 📖Bookworm community:
In this community , the users will get access to varius free ebooks and audiobooks. They can also talk to each other with the chat option here.
### 🎶Music community:
In the Music community , the users can get access to the song they want and listen to it just by saying.
### 👩‍🍳Cook Book community:
In this community, we will provide links to various food recipes that they can use.
### 💰Buying and Selling community:
In this community,they can sell their handmade goods and even buy the works of other users.

## 📽️Tutorials

In the Tutorials section, the users can learn about various basic things that we need in our daily  lives such as, how to switch on and off their mobile phones,how to set an alarm, and so on.

## 👩‍💻About us
In the About Us section, we have given our objective for this website.
## ☎️Contact Us
In this section, we have provided a form where the users can login their Gmail accounts and tell us anything they want to say.

## 💀 Challenges faced
- We faced some problems with the repository so we had to pull the code from the repository and push it in again. 
- We were trying to use MySQL and php  for storing the information of the Login page but we were facing problems like the passwords were not being stored so we moved on to Firebase.
- In the Contact Us page, we were trying to implement a back-end SQL but we were facing problems there so we used JavaScript for that.
- In the buying and selling page, we faced problems in the payment section so we are trying to solve that issue.

## 🎯Future Goals of the project
- We are trying to modify a proper payment option for the buying and selling page.
- We are currently working on the design of the Tutorial Section.
- We are trying to make a chat section under the communuty sections and we trying to add a speech to text convertor to reduce the hassle of typing.
